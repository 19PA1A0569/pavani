BENEFITS:
1.from the above project we understand the functions of pandas.
2.from the above project we can understand the importance of pandas.
3.we learn how to draw histograph and whether it is left or right skew.
4. we learn many many libraries.mathplot which are available in machine learning.
5. we learn how to use github and google colab and we gained an experience.

CONCLUSION:
So, we finally used machine learning and mathplot libraries to make histograph and describe the variable in the data

        Thanks for providing precious opportunity to us.
