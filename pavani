        "Introduction:\n",
        "The 2018 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match that took place on 15 July 2018 to determine the winners of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It was the final of the 21st FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The match was played by France and Croatia, and held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before 2018, France's only World Cup victory was in 1998 – though they had also reached the final in 2006 – while Croatia were playing in their first World Cup final.\n",
        "\n",
        "France won the match 4–2, having taken a 2–1 lead during the first half on an own goal and penalty awarded by the video assistant referee (VAR), both firsts in a World Cup final. France also became the second team in the 32-team World Cup to win all their knockout matches in regulation time, after Brazil in 2002. The final was watched by a global audience of 1.12 billion people on television and streaming platforms.\n",
        "Context:\n",
        "ated in the Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug. An expanded version of the stadium was named as the provisional final venue in Russia's World Cup bid, which was selected by FIFA on 2 December 2010.[5] Luzhniki Stadium was confirmed as the final venue on 14 December 2012, following a meeting of the now-erswthile FIFA Executive Committee held in Tokyo, Japan.[6] The stadium also hosted six other matches, including the opening match on 14 June, three group stage matches, a round of 16 match, and the second semi-final match.[7][8]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The exterior of the Luzhniki Stadium at night with Moscow State University in the background.\n",
        "The Luzhniki Stadium, previously known as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium until 1992, originally opened in 1956 as part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex to host the USSR Summer Spartakiade.[9][10] The stadium has served as the national stadium of the country, hosting many matches for the Russia national team and its predecessor, the Soviet Union national team.[7][11] In the past, the stadium has been used as the home ground at various times for CSKA Moscow, Torpedo Moscow, and Spartak Moscow. However, there are currently no clubs based at the stadium.[11][12]\n",
        "\n",
        "The stadium has hosted numerous international sporting events. The stadium was the main venue for the 1980 Summer Olympics, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, football (four matches, including the gold medal match), and the Individual Jumping Grand Prix.[10][13] The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, as well as the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final.[14] Other events staged include the Spartakiad, the final game of the 1957 Ice Hockey World Championships, the 1973 Summer Universiade, the Friendship Games in 1984, the 1986 Goodwill Games, and the 1998 World Youth Games.[15][16] In 2013, the Rugby World Cup Sevens and World Athletics Championships were held at the ground in front of sparse crowds.[17] The stadium has also served as a venue for many concerts, including Western artists after the fall of the Soviet Union,[13] as well as political rallies.[18]\n",
        "\n",
        "Rated as a category 4 stadium by UEFA, the Luzhniki Stadium is the largest in Russia and at the 2018 World Cup; it usually has a maximum capacity of 81,006, but was reduced to 78,011 for the World Cup.[11][19] This also makes the stadium the largest in Eastern Europe,[20] and among the largest in Europe.[21][22] To prepare for the World Cup, the stadium was closed for extensive renovations in August 2013.[23] The spectator stands were moved closer to the pitch, which was converted from artificial turf to natural grass, after the removal of the athletic track. The historic facade of the stadium was preserved due to its architectural value, while the roof was upgraded using a new polycarbonate skin with exterior lighting.[24][25] The Luzhniki did not host any matches at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup due to the ongoing project.[26] The renovation project cost €341 million,[27] and the stadium officially reopened with an international friendly between Russia and Argentina on 11 November 2017.[28]\n",
        "Data:\n",
        "France entered the 2018 World Cup as one of the favourites to win the tournament, particularly for their strong squad featuring several youth talents.[45] The team finished as runners-up to Portugal at Euro 2016, which the country hosted.[45] The team qualified for the World Cup finals after finishing first in their qualification group, ahead of Sweden and the Netherlands.[45]\n",
        "\n",
        "At the World Cup, France were drawn into Group C alongside Australia, Denmark, and Peru. The team defeated Australia 2–1 in its opening match in Kazan, with a penalty called by the video assistant referee and scored by Antoine Griezmann followed by an own goal deflected by Australian defender Aziz Behich.[46] In its second match, France won 1–0 over Peru on a goal scored by 19-year-old Kylian Mbappé, who became France's youngest goalscorer at a major tournament.[47][48] The victory over Peru qualified France for the knockout stage, allowing manager Didier Deschamps to rest several starting players for the final group stage match against Denmark. The match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow finished in a scoreless draw marked by misplaced passes and goalkeeping mistakes.[49] The team's group stage performance was characterised as lacking cohesion and failing to use its star players effectively.[50]\n",
